# Nzen2-DDoSpy
An Distributed Denial Of Service (DDoS) / Network stress test program, made with Python 3.9
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Primarily a network stress test program, you can push your router to its knees.

"The longer you run, the more packets sent"

This is the continuation, or port to python 3.9, of BAT-DDoS-Nzen2, which is archived here:

(RIP, my first github repo...)
Attempting to DoS servers, or routers does nothing, but DoS-ing a home-hosted minecraft server,
when it is full might kick everyone out. 







Just in case, I'm not responsible for any damages caused by the user.
DDoS-ing and DoS-ing anyone without their consent IS A CRIME
If you do indeed have the former's consent, it's called "Network stress testing"

This program is made for educational purposes only.
Use at your own risk.
