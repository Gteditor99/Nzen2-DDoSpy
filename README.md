The "Computer Fraud and Abuse Act" (1986)
prohibits intentionally impairing the operation of a computer,
or prevent or hinder access to a program/data on a computer,
unless you are authorised to do so.

Common sense dictates
with authorization, 
(Such as on your own privately owned devices,)
it can be deemed legal, 
(as it is assumed that no user is prohibited 
from using their devices on their own accords)
and the owner of said devices will not recive 
punishments against their own property that they have purposely 
'denied of service(s)', as they have been granted authorization by themselves 
from the moment said owner commenced the 'denial'.
